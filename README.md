ngD3
---

A D3 wrapper, the angular way. Delegates D3 to model ngD3, with factory $d3, to keep it out of the global scope.


## Use

* Add a dependency to module `ngD3`

* Inject a dependency to $d3 in your functions

*$d3 now aliases d3!*

---

No code was added (yet) except for the wrapper. If you have a clean directive, please send a pull request to [ngD3](http://github.com/zzmp/ngD3).

Happy hacking! Keep it clean and DRY!
